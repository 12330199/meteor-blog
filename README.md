# Meteor Blog

A meteorite package that relies on Iron Router and gives you a blog at
/blog.

We want something to work with that uses Iron Router, Bootstrap 3, and
doesn't require us to run another dyno for a meteor-based blog.

## Roadmap

* Basic WYSIWYG editor 
* Easily add images
* URL's based on slug from title (but be editable)
* Allow for comments (or at least a comment plugin)
* Ability to create categories/tags
* Widget to embed recent posts on another page
* Customize how posts are displayed on main blog home
* Use Google+ attributions for SEO
* Other SEO best practices
